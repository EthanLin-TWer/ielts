以下套路，均来自于[十天突破雅思写作](https://item.jd.com/14841298086.html)一书，真的非常好。

## 大作文

### 1. 找论点：STREEC法

* **S**kill - Efficiency
* **T**ethnology - Safety
* **R**ight - Responsibility
* **E**nvironment - Health
* **E**mployment - Finance
* **C**ulture - Fun

练习的时候，学会穷举排查有关的短语。熟练了以后，大概瞟一下，哪几个话题大概率是没关系的先排除，在剩下的话题中找例子，可以加快速度、提升效率，最后论点不够的话再回来那些被干掉的话题中再找找。

### 2. 定类型：Argument型还是Report型

Argument（辩论类）要求考生**辩论观点**或**比较利弊**，占最近5年亚太区考试的85%，是应该重点备考的类型。Argument又有四种提问方式：

| No. | 提问方式| 类型| 频率| 建议| 
| :---:  | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- | 
| 1 | Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. | **双方讨论**型（D & G型） | 高 | 重点备考 | 
| 2 | Do you agree or disagree? / To what extent do you agree or disagree? | **同不同意**型 | 高 | 重点备考 | 
| 3 | Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? | **比较利弊**型 | 中 | 次重点备考 | 
|  | To what extent do you think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks? ||  |  | 
| 4 | What is your opinion? / What is your view?  | **你怎么看**型 | 低 | 看一两个模板就好| 

Report（分析解释类）题目没有结论和观点，仅给出现象，要求考生**分析原因/问题/影响/因素（causes/problems/effects/factors）**，或者**给出方案/措施（solutions/measures）**。

### 3. 定结构：采用4段式还是5段式

两种结构的基本构成如下。采用的标准在于**分论点的详实程度**。想不到太多论点（≤2），但是每个论点可用的支撑句多，那就用5段式，一个论点一段；能想到很多论点（>2），但是每个论点能想到的支撑句比较少，那就4段式只写正反两段，但是写长一点。

* 4段式结构：开头段（1-3句）+正论点主体段（6-8句）+反论点主体段（4-6句）+结论段（1-3句）
* 5段式结构：开头段（1-3句）+正论点主体段1（2-4句）+正论点主体段2（2-4句）+反论点主体段1（2-4句）+结论段（1-3句）

#### 开头段3句话怎么写

跟作文类型小有关联。下面穷举如下：

**Argument - 双方讨论**型（D & G型）一般套路是：转述背景1句+完整转述双方观点1-2句。这种题不需要你首先给出自己的观点（当然你非要给也行）。

> Some people think that ... . Others, however, have a different view(believe) that ... .
> 
> Some people believe that ..., while other argue that ... .

**Argument - 同不同意**型一般套路是：转述背景1句+完整转述观点1句+表达意见1句。因为问你是否同意，所以需要你表达观点。

> (Background). While some argue that ..., I tend to believe that ... .
>  
> (Background). Although I agree that ..., but I think(believe) that ... .
> 
> (Background). Some think that ... . I disagree with this view. 

**Argument - 比较利弊**型一般套路是：转述背景1句+表达赞不赞成1句。

> People have different views about ... . While ... can have benefits, I believe that ... .
> 
> People have different views about ... . Some people think that ..., I do believe that the advantages(benefits) of this outweigh the disadvantages(drawbacks).

**Report**型一般答题套路为：先看清要分析的方面（是成因还是方案，还是两者），简洁的语言转述背景1句+概括自己要进行的分析1-2句。

> There are several causes of/reasons for this trend.  
> 
> I think A, B and C are responsible for this trend.

摆方案的时候可以这样开始：

> Various measures could be taken to solve/tackle this/the problem.

#### 结尾段怎么写

* **双方讨论**型：In my opinion, A would not be the best way to ..., we should instead do B.
* **同不同意**型：In conclusion, I agree that A would do ... . However, I believe that B ... .
* **比较利弊**型：Overall, it seems to me that the benefit of A outweighs the drawbacks.
* **Report**型：In conclusion, there are various reasons for ..., but measures could be taken to solve the issue.

### 4. 定支撑句

支撑句一般要分话题来掌握，多吸收一点词汇。一般来说，一个分论点就是3句话展开（结构如下所示），次重要的分论点可省去举例过程。

**分论点（Ideas）** ----> **深入展开（Explain in Details）** ----> **举例（Examples）**

深入展开的部分，思考过程可以从三个基本问题入手：Why？So？What？我自己总结的思考过程可以这样：

1. 如果论点中有名词/子论点过于抽象，连What（在说啥）都不清楚，那么可以尝试从**What**入手充实一下
2. 如果What是清楚的，但Why不是非常直白，那么就从**Why**入手分析一下原因
3. 如果论点过于直白/常识，What/Why都非常清楚，那么就从**So**入手讲讲其带来的结果和影响

### 5. 连接词

最常用的连接方式大概有3种：连接词、代词及等价名词。其中直接使用**连接词**的方式称为明链接，使用**代词**或**等价名词**做指代的方式称为暗连接。都可以用，最好是**适当**使用**多种**方法，以不造成审美疲劳为原则。

明连接的主要连接词如下表所示。前5种多用于进一步**充实事实、铺陈材料**，后3种多用于通过“因果”“假设/让步”来**推动论述发展**。

| | 展开方式 | 常用连接词 | 
| :---: | :---: | :--- | 
| What | 举例展开 | For example .., for instance .., such as .. | 
|      | 下定义展开 | This means that .., in other words .. | 
|      | 限定范围展开 | Specifically, .. | 
|      | 类比展开 | Similarly, .. | 
|      | 对比展开 | By contrast, .., While .., Unlike .. | 
| Why  | 让步展开 | Although .. | 
|      | 假设展开 | if, may, could, would, would .. if/without | 
| So   | 因果展开 | As a result, .., Therefore .. | 

与明连接不同，暗连接（指示代词/名词）依赖的是上下文之间**内在的**语义或逻辑联系。

> 注意写作中几个不可数名词：information, knowledge, feedback, advice, equipment, behaviour, potential

## 小作文

写小作文有具体的套路。一般来说，写四段。每段的长度基本确定（因为词数限制），主体段和结尾段的内容大同小异，其他段则视信件内容不同而有不同。写信过程**注意简洁、不要啰嗦**，**所选语言正式程度应与收信对象相匹配**。

* 主体段一：简要提出写信目的，是请求、建议还是感谢等（I'm writing to request ...）。一般1-2句
* 主体段二：阐明写信动机，你想干嘛。具体内容视信件类型不同而不同。一般3-4句
* 主体段三：进一步提出自己希望的效果。具体内容视信件类型不同而不同。一般4-5句
* 主体段四：对于“请求/建议/邀请”信而言，表示希望尽快得到回复；对于“抱怨/道歉/感谢”信而言，表示希望强化行动（比如道歉就表示自己会有所行动、抱怨则希望对方有所行动、感谢就再谢一次）。一般1-2句

下面罗列一下不同风格下的开头、中间、结尾风格：

|        | 正式                                         | 半正式           | 非正式                     |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
|  开头  | Dear Sir/Madam                               | Dear Mr/Ms Smith | Dear John                  |
|        | Dear Sir or Madam                            | Dear Mrs Smith   | Hi Ann                     |
| 主体段 | I'm writing with regard to ...               | 同正式用语       | I am writing about ...     |
|        | I am interested in receiving ...             | 同正式用语       | Please send me ...         |
|  结尾  | I am looking forward to hearing from you ... | 同正式用语       | Hope to hear from you soon |
|  落款  | Yours faithfully,                            | Yours sincerely, | Regards,                   |
|        |                                              | Sincerely,       | Best wishes,               |

### Making a request

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明自己面临的情况，如果希望更充实还可以初步提及自己的要求
* 主体段三：具体来说，细化自己所需要的帮助，还可以再说明对方满足自己的请求确实具有可行性的理由

```
**I'm writing to** request some annual leave next month.

My wife and I were married last year, but the honeymoon has been postponed due to the coronavirus situation. We would really love to spend some time together as new couples, given the world is recovering and businesses are opening up. (简要说明背景，你想度蜜月了)

**To do this**, **I would need to take the time off for a next month**, from Monday 10th to Friday 14th. **My schedule for that week is relatively light**, apart from some coding work. **I'll transfer the knowledge before I leave, and Jeff would be able to pick it up easily**, since we were pairing at the piece I'm working on, and he has all the context needed. Besides that, **I don't have any urgent stuff to handle at that time**. (To do this从第二段的背景转折过来提出请求。接下来罗列理由：工作轻、有人接手、不紧急)

**I would be grateful if you could allow my leave**. **It'll be an important event in our lives that we don't want to miss**. **Please let me know your thoughts**. (希望请求被满足、强调事件重要性、表明希望收到回复。这三句都可作为模板背诵)

Best wishes, (工作信件应正式，不能写Yours等)
```

### Making a suggestions

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明出现的情况（你想要提建议所针对的情况），如果希望更充实可以初步说明自己的建议
* 主体段三：具体来说，细化自己的建议，若希望更充实还可以提出另一种备选方案

```
Dear Jan, (因为是朋友所以可以Dear)

As you know, we'll be moving to a new house soon and there are a few things that I won't be able to take with me. I need to sell some of my furniture, and **I'm writing to see if you would be interested**? (说明写信目的是看对方有无兴趣买家具，同时简单交代了背景)

**In particular** **I want to sell my couch**. Do you remember it - the yellow one in the living room? We used to sit together and watch TVs when you visited last time. It's soft, cozy and super comfortable. It's long, and it could cater 3 or 4 people. On the weekend, you can even lay there and reading books, it would be very relaxing. (简要介绍你要卖的东西)

**I know you've always liked this furniture**, **so I could let you have it at a good price**. **I'd prefer sell it to you than to a stranger**. (强化对方可买的理由：你喜欢、给你优惠、我跟你关系好)

**So why don't you come around and have a look yourself on Sunday**? I'll be here for all day, so **maybe we could have some lunch together**? (提出邀请、有人情味)

**Give me a ring and let me know.** (希望她来)

Yours, (这里就可以用Yours了)
```

### Making an apology

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明自己**做了什么**对对方产生了**什么影响**
* 主体段三：具体来说，应提出自己打算**采取什么行动**来停止影响

```
Dear James,

**I was very upset** (to get your letters saying/knowing) that <trouble source> **has been spoiling your evenings and causing you some distress**. **I am really, really sorry about that**. **I had no idea that** you would be able to hear so much, so **I hope you will accept my apologies**. (说知道了很不安，我十分抱歉，我原本不知道，希望你能接受我道歉。这四个句子都可以是模板，背诵之)

**As you may have guessed**, I'm trying to refit my kitchen in the evenings when I get home from work. Unfortunately it is all taking longer than expected and I have been having problems with getting things to fit properly. This has meant a lot of banging and hammering. (解释一下，留意句头的过渡)

As the kitchen is still not finished, **I have decided to** call in a professional builder who will finish the work in the next day or two. He'll work only during daytime hours, **so you won't be** disturbed in the evenings again, **I promise**. (将采取行动，因此你不会再收到影响，我保证)

**Sorry to have caused the troubles.** (不好意思给你添麻烦了)

Jeff
```

### Making a complaint

抱怨信有两种，一种是抱怨已经发生的事情，这种信的重点是强调既成事实所带来的问题，以及如何改变现状；一种是抱怨仍在计划之中、尚未实施的事情，这种信的本质是对计划进行劝阻，因此重点是在强调现状很美好，如果改变将会带来什么问题。同时，抱怨信的文体和用词通常会较为正式一些。

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明对方可能、或者已经造成的影响
* 主体段三：具体来说，进一步说明对方已经造成或者可能造成的问题有多严重，充实一些还可以讲讲如何改变现状（或为什么不要改变）

```
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Irana Smirnova and **I am writing to raise my concerns regarding** the plans to close our local sports and leisure center. (表明写作目的，是要抱怨/表达关切)

**It is hard to underestimate the importance of this center for citizens.** **In fact**, it became the point where we all meet each other to share some positive emotions and spend free time. **Also**, one **cannot** miss the influence of sporting activities provided there on the health of the people. (理由一般讲两点，In fact/Also，用反义来讲似乎高级一点：不能低估重要性、不能低估影响，论点要高，比如运动使人健康，不运动就使人不健康)

My family is used to going to the center several times a week. My husband and I attended fitness lessons for adults on Monday and Friday after work. My two sons went to the center after school; they have a place there to do their homework, to play with other children and relax in safe environment. On weekends, we usually meet friends there and go to the swimming pool and open-air tennis courts. (题目要求，其实也是展开论述，不需要什么华丽的句子)

I can think of **several negative consequences** the closure of the center would do. **The first impact** is that people could become less engaged in sport activities which will definitely affect their health. **The second thing is going to cause** is that children will lose the opportunity to spend their time in a healthy atmosphere and will spend more time at the street. **Finally**, for the people interested in sports it will become more difficult to get to the place to exercise as the nearest sports center is in Toronto which is 30 miles away. (“不好的结果”用的是比较正式的文体，气势一下就出来了。一二三那个排比是从拜登的演讲里抄来的)

I believe this question **deserves close attention**. (再次强调需要重点关注，表达关切)

Yours faithfully,
Irina Smirnova.
```

### Extending an invitation

一般来说，如果是私人的朋友之间的邀请，语气可以稍微不那么正式（但还是要遵循不缩写的原则），行文可以稍微轻松一点。

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明邀请的原因，除了借助原题里的信息也允许适当的想象
* 主体段三：具体来说，应进一步说明邀请的细节，如**地点电话**、其他参加人员情况、希望到达的**具体时间**等

```
Dear Jeff,

**I'm writing to let you know** that we finally **moved into our new house**! You know, the previous one was a bit too small after we adopted this Alaska pet dog who is growing up so quick! (写信告知目的、搬新家常见说法)

**I bet you will like it**. Now we have a big live room, three bedrooms and a very modern kitchen. We even have a garden with a large lawn! We also bought a large Samsung TV with pretty sharp color and high resolution in the living room, so we could just sit back in the cozy couch and play video games if you pay a visit. Oh, and Lion, the Alaska, he's the happiest one, because he can run freely now and have fun in the large lawn outside! (介绍新房常见说法，你会喜欢的。其他的都是日常介绍)

**So why don't you come and take a look by yourself this weekend**? **We would all love to see you**. We could play games or have a barbecue in the garden if the weather is good. (邀请+约定时间+表达欢迎，这两句都可以当做模板背诵)

**Our new address and phone number are below**. **Just give me a call**, and **let us know when to expect you**. (告知地点和电话+表示希望收到回信)

Yours,
Blabla
```

### Thank-you Letters

* 主体段二：具体来说，应说明对方做了什么，并给自己带来了什么好处/方便
* 主体段三：具体来说，更进一步地说明，对方做的事情对自己有多么多么重要
